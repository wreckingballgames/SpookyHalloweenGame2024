It's Halloween and all the kids in the neighborhood are divvying up their candy hauls. In a flash of green light, extraterrestrial invaders touch down and initiate all-out war.

The kids run to the first person they think of for a situation like this: crazy Professor Bolo up on the hill. The professor appraises the situation and equips the kids with some (semi-)kid friendly weapons.

Now it's up to a handful of kids with bad attitudes to save the oblivious adults from total destruction.
